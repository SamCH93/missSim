## Reproducing our results

To reproduce the case study, refer to the files in `case-study/`

* `case-study/carter2019-data-cleaning.R` R script to clean the
  `res.wide.red.RData` data from Carter et al. (2019,
  <https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245919847196>) and create
  `case-study/carter2019.rda`. The file `res.wide.red.RData` is too large for a
  GitHub repository. If you want to reproduce this step, clone
  <https://github.com/nicebread/meta-showdown> and run the R script
  `3-resultsFramework.R` to create `res.wide.red.RData`
* `case-study/carter2019.rda` cleaned summary data in rda format (required for
  analysis)
* `case-study/carter2019-analysis.Qmd` quarto file containing R code for case
  study analysis
* `case-study/carter2019-analysis.html` case study analysis output containing
  also information on computational environment (OS, R, R packages) used to run
  analysis
* `case-study/figures/` figure outputs used in the paper


To reproduce the literature review analyses, refer to the files in
`literature-review/` and `data/`

* `literature-review/data_cleaning.R` R script to clean and merge literature
  review data from the four coders
* `data/` contains cleaned literature review data files in RDS and xlsx formats
  (required for analysis)
* `literature-review/analysis.Qmd` quarto file containing R code for literature
  review analysis
* `literature-review/analysis.html` literature review analysis analysis output
  containing also information on computational environment (OS, R, R packages)
  used to run analysis
* `literature-review/figures/` figure outputs used in the paper
* `literature-review/coding-agreement/` quarto files for agreement randomization
  and analysis
  
To reproduce our analyses using a Docker container that encapsulates the
computational environment used, refer to the files

* `Dockerfile` Dockerfile to recreate the computational environment used in the
  simulation study
* `Makefile` Makefile to conveniently build and run the Docker analysis: Make
  sure to have Docker and Make installed, then run `make docker` from the root
  directory of this git repository. This will install all necessary
  dependencies. RStudio Server can then be opened from a browser
  (<http://localhost:8787>), and the R and quarto files in `case-study/` and
  `literature-review/` can be rerun
